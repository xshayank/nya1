## How It Works

```
Client -> Local Proxy -> Google/CDN front -> GoogleAppsScript (GAS) Relay -> Cloudflare Worker -> Target website
             |
             +-> shows www.google.com to the network DPI filter
```
In normal use, the browser sends traffic to the proxy running on your computer.
The proxy sends that traffic through Google-facing infrastructure so the network only sees an allowed domain such as `www.google.com`.
Your deployed relay then fetches the real website through cloudflare worker and sends the response back through the same path.

This means the filter sees normal-looking Google traffic, while the actual destination stays hidden inside the relay request.

## How to Use

### 1 - Download project and extract 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denuitt1/mhr-cfw.git
cd mhr-cfw
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> **Can't reach PyPI directly?** Use this mirror instead:
> ```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirror-pypi.runflare.com/simple/ --trusted-host mirror-pypi.runflare.com
> ```


### 2 - Set Up the Cloudflare Worker (worker.js)

1. Open [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and sign in with your Cloudflare account.
2. From the sidebar, navigate to **Compute > Workers & Pages**
3. Click **Create Application**, Choose **Start with Hello World** and click on **Deploy**
4. Click on **Edit code** and **Delete** all the default code in the editor.
5. Open the [`worker.js`](script/worker.js) file from this project (under `script/`), **copy everything**, and paste it into the Apps Script editor.
6. **Important:** Change the worker on this line to the worker you created:
   ```javascript
   const WORKER_URL = "myworker.workers.dev";
   ```
7. Click **Deploy**.

### 3 - Set Up the Google Relay (Code.gs)

1. Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.
2. Click **New project**.
3. **Delete** all the default code in the editor.
4. Open the [`Code.gs`](script/Code.gs) file from this project (under `script/`), **copy everything**, and paste it into the Apps Script editor.
5. **Important:** Change the password on this line to something only you know, also replace the worker url with your cloudflare worker:
   ```javascript
   const AUTH_KEY = "your-secret-password-here";
   const WORKER_URL "https://myworker.workers.dev";
   ```
6. Click **Deploy** → **New deployment**.
7. Choose **Web app** as the type.
8. Set:
   - **Execute as:** Me
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
9. Click **Deploy**.
10. **Copy the Deployment ID** (it looks like a long random string). You'll need it in the next step.

> ⚠️ Remember the password you set in step 3. You'll use the same password in the config file below.

### 4 - Configure the config.json file

1. Copy the example config file:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   ```
   On Windows, you can also just copy & rename the file manually.

2. Open `config.json` in any text editor and fill in your values:
   ```json

	"mode": "apps_script",
	"google_ip": "216.239.38.120",

}
   ```
   - `script_id` → Paste the Deployment ID from Step 3.
   - `auth_key` → The **same password** you set in `Code.gs`.

### 4 - Run

Simply click on `start.bat` file (on windows) or `start.sh` (on linux).

or if you want to run it manually:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

You should see a message saying the HTTP proxy is running on `127.0.0.1:8085`

You can use [FoxyProxy](https://getfoxyproxy.org/) [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/foxyproxy/gcknhkkoolaabfmlnjonogaaifnjlfnp?hl=en) or [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) to use this proxy in your browser.

### 5 - Test your connection

Open [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) in your browser, you should see your ip address set as cloudflare's.
